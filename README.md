# Senate Council Database
## Senate Council Abstract

The Senate-Council DB is a database used to record USFs Senate Council's current membership. From the remains of the HDAR project, this project was used to track member's personal information across several councils, the length of their terms, and activity within their designated council.  

## Database Versions
This folder contains all versions of the Access database, VB notes, and the original masterlist used to create the database structure.
